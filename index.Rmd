## Project thoughts

Data Set:
The data set I am using is a list of Crimes that took place in Los Angeles in 2020. They are listed by type of crime, as well as by details of the victim, including their race, gender and age.

Research Question:
With regards to the two most common crime types in LA, is there a specific target group for each of these two types of crimes? Is this consistent with regards to the target group being on the receiving end of the most number of crimes overall? What can we deduce from this with regards to how the nature of these two crime types affects criminals' decisions in choosing their targets?

Hypothesis:
There will be a significant difference in all of race, gender and age between the most common victim group of those of the two crimes and that overall.
